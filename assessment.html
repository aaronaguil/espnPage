				style="text-decoration: underline;">DENVER</a> -- Filling in for
				Peyton Manning. Facing Tom Brady -- and a two-touchdown deficit in
				the fourth quarter. None of it bothered Brock Osweiler. The
				25-year-old quarterback making his first career start in Denver felt
				right at home in the snow globe that was Sports Authority Field on
				Sunday night, where the Broncos handed the New England Patriots
				their first loss, 30-24 in overtime. It all reminded him of his
				youth in Kalispell, Montana, where misfires in the backyard ended up
				in snowbanks "and you'd have to dust off all the snow," Osweiler
				said. "Fortunately, when you play in the NFL, there are guys on the
				sideline that dust off all the snow. "But, yeah, it was fun." Not
				for Brady, who lost yet another one of his trusted targets when star
				tight end Rob Gronkowski injured his right knee with 2:49 left in
				the fourth quarter on a clean hit by safety Darian Stewart and was
				carted off the field. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<span id="first-word">Brady's receiving corps already was
				depleted with injuries to Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, Aaron
				Dobson and running back Dion Lewis. If Gronkowski's injury is
				serious, it could be the biggest loss of all. "He's been through a
				lot, he's a tough guy," Brady said. "Hopefully, it's not too
				serious. All of our fingers are crossed." Stewart swept in low,
				trying to break up the pass that fell incomplete. "I hate to see it
				but it's really the only way for defenders to hit now," Brady said.
				"I bet if you ask a bunch of players they'd rather you go high than
				low. When you go low that's what happens. I don't think it's dirty.
				I just think it's the way football's being played now." Gronkowski,
				who caught his ninth touchdown pass and led New England with six
				receptions for 88 yards before getting hurt, didn't speak with
				reporters afterward. He walked to the team bus with a slight limp
				but no brace and coach Bill Belichick said he had no update. The
				Broncos (9-2) won it when C.J. Anderson bounced a run outside and
				raced 48 yards down Denver's jubilant sideline with 12:32 left in
				overtime after its top-ranked defense forced a three-and-out thanks
				to a big sack by Von Miller and a huge hit by Shane Ray. Manning
				watched from the cozy indoors as his backup brought the Broncos back
				from a 21-7 fourth-quarter deficit and Denver handed the Patriots
				(10-1) their first loss since 2014. New England's last loss was a
				meaningless 17-9 defeat to Buffalo on Dec. 28 before the Patriots
				won three games to claim another Super Bowl trophy and then swept
				through their first 10 this season. Now, the Carolina Panthers
				(11-0) are the NFL's only remaining unbeaten team. The Broncos never
				led until Osweiler threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Bubba Caldwell
				with 1:09 left in regulation to put Denver ahead 24-21. But Brady
				needed just five plays to drive the Patriots 51 yards and into range
				for Stephen Gostkowski's 47-yard field goal with no time left. New
				England won the coin toss and Denver's defense, which lost starters
				T.J. Ward and Sylvester Williams to ankle injuries on the same play
				in the first half, had to go right back out. "It didn't look good at
				times," Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said, "but we figured out a way to
				get it done." Anderson rushed for 113 yards and two TDs on 15
				carries. Overall, the Broncos ran for 179 yards, particularly
				impressive given their double-digit deficit for most of the night
				and their 21-7 hole after Brady threw a 63-yard scoring pass to
				Brandon Bolden on the first play of the fourth quarter. The Patriots
				managed just 39 yards on 16 carries. Osweiler completed 23 of 42
				passes for 270 yards with one TD and one interception on a tipped
				pass. Brady also was 23 of 42 for 280 yards with three TDs and no
				interceptions. With Manning sitting this one out in a walking cast
				on his left foot, the greatest quarterback rivalry was put on hold
				-- perhaps forever. Instead of a 17th meeting between the QB greats,
				it was Brady versus Osweiler, which doesn't have the same Hall of
				Fame ring to it. It still had plenty of panache. Things looked bleak
				for the Broncos after Bolden's TD made it 21-7 and New England
				forced a three-and-out. But Chris Harper muffed the punt and Shaq
				Barrett recovered for Denver at the Patriots 36. That led to
				Anderson's 15-yard TD run. A short field goal pulled them to 21-17.

				Then, Demaryius Thomas, who didn't catch any of the first 11 balls
				thrown his way, hauled in a 36-yard pass to midfield just before the
				2-minute warning that ignited Denver's go-ahead TD drive. "That's
				what great players do," Osweiler said. "No matter what happens in
				the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter or even early
				fourth quarter, big players step up in big times." He easily could
				have been talking about himself.
